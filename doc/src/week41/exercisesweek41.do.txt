TITLE: Exercises week 41
AUTHOR: October 4-11, 2024
DATE: Deadline is Friday October 11 at midnight


=======  Overarching aims of the exercises this week =======

The aim of the exercises this week is to get started with implementing
gradient methods of relevance for project 2. This exercise will also
be continued next week with the addition of automatic differentation.
Everything you develop here will be used in project 2.

In order to get started, we will now replace in our standard ordinary
least squares (OLS) and Ridge regression codes (from project 1) the
matrix inversion algorithm with our own gradient descent (GD) and SGD
codes.  You can use the Franke function or the terrain data from
project 1. _However, we recommend using a simpler function like_
$f(x)=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2$ or higher-order one-dimensional polynomials.
You can obviously test your final codes against for example the Franke
function. Automatic differentiation will be discussed next week.

You should include in your analysis of the GD and SGD codes the following elements
o A plain gradient descent with a fixed learning rate (you will need to tune it) using the analytical expression of the gradients
o Add momentum to the plain GD code and compare convergence with a fixed learning rate (you may need to tune the learning rate), again using the analytical expression of the gradients.
o Repeat these steps for stochastic gradient descent with mini batches and a given number of epochs. Use a tunable learning rate as discussed in the lectures from week 39. Discuss the results as functions of the various parameters (size of batches, number of epochs etc)
o Implement the Adagrad method in order to tune the learning rate. Do this with and without momentum for plain gradient descent and SGD.
o Add RMSprop and Adam to your library of methods for tuning the learning rate.
The lecture notes from weeks 39 and 40 contain more information and code examples. Feel free to use these examples.

In summary, you should 
perform an analysis of the results for OLS and Ridge regression as
function of the chosen learning rates, the number of mini-batches and
epochs as well as algorithm for scaling the learning rate. You can
also compare your own results with those that can be obtained using
for example _Scikit-Learn_'s various SGD options.  Discuss your
results. For Ridge regression you need now to study the results as functions of  the hyper-parameter $\lambda$ and 
the learning rate $\eta$.  Discuss your results.

You will need your SGD code for the setup of the Neural Network and
Logistic Regression codes. You will find the Python "Seaborn
package":"https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html"
useful when plotting the results as function of the learning rate
$\eta$ and the hyper-parameter $\lambda$ when you use Ridge
regression.

We recommend reading chapter 8 on optimization from the textbook of "Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville":"https://www.deeplearningbook.org/". This chapter contains many useful insights and discussions on the optimization part of machine learning.


=======  Code examples from week 39 and 40 =======




===== Code with a Number of Minibatches which varies, analytical gradient =====

In the code here we vary the number of mini-batches.
!bc pycode
# Importing various packages
from math import exp, sqrt
from random import random, seed
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

n = 100
x = 2*np.random.rand(n,1)
y = 4+3*x+np.random.randn(n,1)

X = np.c_[np.ones((n,1)), x]
XT_X = X.T @ X
theta_linreg = np.linalg.inv(X.T @ X) @ (X.T @ y)
print("Own inversion")
print(theta_linreg)
# Hessian matrix
H = (2.0/n)* XT_X
EigValues, EigVectors = np.linalg.eig(H)
print(f"Eigenvalues of Hessian Matrix:{EigValues}")

theta = np.random.randn(2,1)
eta = 1.0/np.max(EigValues)
Niterations = 1000


for iter in range(Niterations):
    gradients = 2.0/n*X.T @ ((X @ theta)-y)
    theta -= eta*gradients
print("theta from own gd")
print(theta)

xnew = np.array([[0],[2]])
Xnew = np.c_[np.ones((2,1)), xnew]
ypredict = Xnew.dot(theta)
ypredict2 = Xnew.dot(theta_linreg)

n_epochs = 50
M = 5   #size of each minibatch
m = int(n/M) #number of minibatches
t0, t1 = 5, 50

def learning_schedule(t):
    return t0/(t+t1)

theta = np.random.randn(2,1)

for epoch in range(n_epochs):
# Can you figure out a better way of setting up the contributions to each batch?
    for i in range(m):
        random_index = M*np.random.randint(m)
        xi = X[random_index:random_index+M]
        yi = y[random_index:random_index+M]
        gradients = (2.0/M)* xi.T @ ((xi @ theta)-yi)
        eta = learning_schedule(epoch*m+i)
        theta = theta - eta*gradients
print("theta from own sdg")
print(theta)

plt.plot(xnew, ypredict, "r-")
plt.plot(xnew, ypredict2, "b-")
plt.plot(x, y ,'ro')
plt.axis([0,2.0,0, 15.0])
plt.xlabel(r'$x$')
plt.ylabel(r'$y$')
plt.title(r'Random numbers ')
plt.show()

!ec



In the above code, we have use replacement in setting up the
mini-batches. The discussion
"here":"https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/sgd-methods.html" may be
useful.  



===== Momentum based GD =====

The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is almost always used with a
*momentum* or inertia term that serves as a memory of the direction we
are moving in parameter space.  This is typically implemented as
follows

!bt
\begin{align}
\mathbf{v}_{t}&=\gamma \mathbf{v}_{t-1}+\eta_{t}\nabla_\theta E(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t) \nonumber \\
\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1}&= \boldsymbol{\theta}_t -\mathbf{v}_{t},
\end{align}
!et

where we have introduced a momentum parameter $\gamma$, with
$0\le\gamma\le 1$, and for brevity we dropped the explicit notation to
indicate the gradient is to be taken over a different mini-batch at
each step. We call this algorithm gradient descent with momentum
(GDM). From these equations, it is clear that $\mathbf{v}_t$ is a
running average of recently encountered gradients and
$(1-\gamma)^{-1}$ sets the characteristic time scale for the memory
used in the averaging procedure. Consistent with this, when
$\gamma=0$, this just reduces down to ordinary SGD as discussed
earlier. An equivalent way of writing the updates is

!bt
\[
\Delta \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1} = \gamma \Delta \boldsymbol{\theta}_t -\ \eta_{t}\nabla_\theta E(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t),
\]
!et
where we have defined $\Delta \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t}= \boldsymbol{\theta}_t-\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t-1}$.

===== Algorithms and codes for Adagrad, RMSprop and Adam =====

The algorithms we have implemented are well described in the text by "Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville, chapter 8":"https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/optimization.html".

The codes which implement these algorithms are discussed after our presentation of automatic differentiation.



===== Practical tips =====

* _Randomize the data when making mini-batches_. It is always important to randomly shuffle the data when forming mini-batches. Otherwise, the gradient descent method can fit spurious correlations resulting from the order in which data is presented.

* _Transform your inputs_. Learning becomes difficult when our landscape has a mixture of steep and flat directions. One simple trick for minimizing these situations is to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and normalizing the variance of input variables. Whenever possible, also decorrelate the inputs. To understand why this is helpful, consider the case of linear regression. It is easy to show that for the squared error cost function, the Hessian of the cost function is just the correlation matrix between the inputs. Thus, by standardizing the inputs, we are ensuring that the landscape looks homogeneous in all directions in parameter space. Since most deep networks can be viewed as linear transformations followed by a non-linearity at each layer, we expect this intuition to hold beyond the linear case.

* _Monitor the out-of-sample performance._ Always monitor the performance of your model on a validation set (a small portion of the training data that is held out of the training process to serve as a proxy for the test set. If the validation error starts increasing, then the model is beginning to overfit. Terminate the learning process. This *early stopping* significantly improves performance in many settings.
	
* _Adaptive optimization methods don't always have good generalization._ Recent studies have shown that adaptive methods such as ADAM, RMSPorp, and AdaGrad tend to have poor generalization compared to SGD or SGD with momentum, particularly in the high-dimensional limit (i.e. the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points). Although it is not clear at this stage why these methods perform so well in training deep neural networks, simpler procedures like properly-tuned SGD may work as well or better in these applications.

Geron's text, see chapter 11, has several interesting discussions.

=====  Using Automatic differentation with OLS =====

We conclude the part on optmization by showing how we can make codes
for linear regression and logistic regression using _autograd_. The
first example shows results with ordinary leats squares.

X = np.c_[np.ones((n,1)), x]
XT_X = X.T @ X
theta_linreg = np.linalg.pinv(XT_X) @ (X.T @ y)

# Hessian matrix
H = (2.0/n)* XT_X
EigValues, EigVectors = np.linalg.eig(H)
print(f"Eigenvalues of Hessian Matrix:{EigValues}")

theta = np.random.randn(2,1)

for iter in range(Niterations):
    gradients = training_gradient(theta)
    theta -= eta*gradients
print("theta from own gd")

===== Introducing "JAX":"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" =====

Presently, instead of using _autograd_, we recommend using "JAX":"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"

_JAX_ is Autograd and "XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra))":"https://www.tensorflow.org/xla",
brought together for high-performance numerical computing and machine learning research.
It provides composable transformations of Python+NumPy programs: differentiate, vectorize, parallelize, Just-In-Time compile to GPU/TPU, and more.

=== Getting started with Jax, note the way we import numpy ===
